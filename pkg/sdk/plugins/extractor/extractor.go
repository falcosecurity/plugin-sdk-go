//   - Init methods are called in sequence and not concurrently. As such,
//     every plugin invoking extract.SetAsync influences behavior of
//     extract.StartAsync only for itself.
//   - The hooks.SetOnBeforeDestroy callback is idempotent, because
//     extract.StopAsync works without having context on whether the current
//     plugin actually used the async optimization. Hence, extract.StopAsync
//     is not influenced by the invocations of extract.SetAsync.
